# Contributing guide

Lucia is a community-informed project instead of a community-driven project. While we are still open to contributions, the overall direction, scope, and goals are ultimately still up to the maintainers. As such, please open a new issue instead of creating a PR for anything larger than a simple bug report. Your PR will likely be rejected if not. Lucia is intended to be limited in scope and simple.

We are currently not accepting any new adapters that requires publishing a new package. We're still open to adapters that can be added to existing packages.
